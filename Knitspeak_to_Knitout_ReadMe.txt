Submission for HW3: KnitSpeak to KnitOut

Method documentation can be found as in-line comments.

Knitout output files produced by my implementations can be found in the my_results\p3_visualizations directory.
These can be reproduced by running the main method in test_knitspeak_compiler.py

No major structure changes were made to the codebase.
