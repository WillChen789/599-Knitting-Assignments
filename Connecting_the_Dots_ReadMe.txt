Submission for HW1: Connecting the Dots

Method documentation can be found as in-line comments.

Knit graph images produced by my implementations can be found in the my_results directory.

Running each test in test_simple_knitgraphs.py individually produces the expected knit graph output image, which gets
sent to the browser. However, please note that running all of the tests together results in an incomplete set of 5 knit
graph images being shown in browser, with some duplicate images and some missing images.
